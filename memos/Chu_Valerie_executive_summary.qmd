## Purpose

I love avocados. Using this [Avocado Prices dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neuromusic/avocado-prices) ^[Kiggins, Justin. "Avocado Prices." Kaggle, 2018, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neuromusic/avocado-prices.], I want to predict the average price of a single avocado (`average_price`) so that I can pinpoint and eventually move to a city with the cheapest avocados...


## Major Takeaways
@fig-final-pred-plot shows the exploration of predictions vs true values: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}

final_pred_plot

```



## Conclusion

In conclusion, the kitchen sink random forest model was the best predictive model out of all model types (Null (baseline model), OLS, Lasso, Ridge, Boosted Tree, K Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest) and across both the kitchen sink and feature engineered recipes. 

In the future, I want to boost the predictive accuracy of this model and work with updated data to predict the average price of a single avocado based on the variables in this dataset. I've accomplished my goal of predicting the average price of a single Haas avocado sold between 2015 and 2018, and now I just need an even more accurate model and an even more updated dataset to pin down the city I want to move to in 2026, a city with the cheapest avocadosâ€¦
